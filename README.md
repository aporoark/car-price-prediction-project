# Car Price Prediction - Excel Regression Project

## Overview
This project analyzes car prices using Excel, including both **linear** and **logarithmic (log10) regression models**. The goal is to understand how various features influence car prices and to predict prices based on the dataset. The project demonstrates data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and regression analysis in Excel.

---

## Statement of Work
The project includes the following workflow:
1. Acquire and clean the dataset
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3. Compute descriptive statistics
4. Build linear and log10 regression models
5. Visualize results and interpret trends

---

## Data Acquisition
- Dataset contains car features and prices (sourced from www.kaggle.com/datasets/mustafaoz158/car-price).  
- All data is anonymized to protect sensitive information.

---

## Raw Data
- `Raw_Data` sheet contains the original dataset before cleaning and preprocessing.  

---

## Data Ethics
- No personally identifiable information (PII) is included.  
- All data handling respects privacy and follows ethical guidelines.  

---

## Data Carpentry
- Data cleaning and preprocessing steps are applied directly in Excel:
  - Handling missing values
  - Standardizing numerical formats
  - Ensuring consistency across feature columns

---

## Data Exploration
- **Price Histograms:** Visualize distribution of car prices.  
- **Heat Chart:** Shows correlations between different features.  
- **Descriptive Statistics Table:** Includes mean, standard error, median, mode, standard deviation, sample variance, and other relevant measures.  

---

## Regression Models
### 1. Linear Regression
- Predicts car prices directly using multiple features.  
- Includes coefficients, R² value, and regression statistics.

### 2. Logarithmic Regression (log10)
- Predicts the log10-transformed car prices to improve model fit and reduce skewness.  
- Includes transformed regression coefficients, R², and predicted price conversion back to original scale.

## Usage
1. Download or clone the repository.  
2. Open `Car_Price_Prediction.xlsx` in Microsoft Excel (or compatible software).  
3. Navigate through the sheets to explore raw data, descriptive statistics, charts, and regression models.  
4. Use charts and tables to interpret relationships between features and car prices.
